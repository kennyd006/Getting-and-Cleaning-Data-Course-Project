## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Scripts:
After downloading and unzipping the source data into the current working directly, 'run_analysis.R' performs the following:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
6. Write tidy data set to the file 'tidyData.txt' file in current working directory
